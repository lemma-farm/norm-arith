# The canonical complete `H¹` carrier

The complete quotient-level carrier for `H¹(U)` is not a second graph
construction. It is the `p = 2` specialization of `W1pGraph`, whose value and
gradient components are `L²` equivalence classes satisfying the closed weak
gradient constraints.

`H1Function U` remains the field-name-compatible concrete-representative
interface. A representative-to-graph map belongs to the generic `W^{1,p}`
bridge and is intentionally not duplicated here.
