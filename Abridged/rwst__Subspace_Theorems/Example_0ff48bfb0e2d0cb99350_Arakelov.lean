# The Arakelov height over a number field

Mathlib's `Height.mulHeight` measures a tuple by the **sup norm** at every place. In Arakelov
theory one instead uses the **ℓ² norm at the archimedean places** — the Fubini–Study metric on
`O(1)` — and keeps the sup norm at the finite places. The resulting height is the one in which
the constants of the Siegel-lemma literature (Bombieri–Vaaler, Schmidt) are stated.

This file defines that normalization over a number field `K` and proves its basic API — scaling
invariance and the descent to projective space, `1 ≤ H_Ar`, invariance under reindexing, and the
affine case — together with the two-sided comparison with `Height.mulHeight`, which is what lets
a bound stated in either normalization be read in the other. Not all of
`Mathlib.NumberTheory.Height.Basic` transfers here — see the implementation notes.

## Main definitions

* `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight x` for `x : ι → K`: the multiplicative Arakelov height
  `∏_{v | ∞} (∑ i, v (x i)²)^{mult v / 2} · ∏ᶠ_{v ∤ ∞} ⨆ i, v (x i)`.
* `NumberField.arakelovLogHeight x`: its logarithm.
* `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight₁ x` and `NumberField.arakelovLogHeight₁ x` for `x : K`:
  the one-variable (affine) case, the height of the tuple `![x, 1]`.
* `Projectivization.arakelovMulHeight` and `Projectivization.arakelovLogHeight`: the descent
  of the above to `Projectivization K (ι → K)`, which the scaling invariance below justifies.

## Main results

* `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight_smul_eq`: invariance under scaling by a nonzero element of
  `K`, by the product formula. This is what makes the height projective.
* `NumberField.one_le_arakelovMulHeight`: the Arakelov height is at least `1`.
* `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight_comp_equiv`: invariance under reindexing.
* `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight_one` and `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight₁_one`: the values
  `#ι ^ (totalWeight K / 2)` and `2 ^ (totalWeight K / 2)` on the all-ones tuple and at `1`,
  where the sup-norm height is `1` — the two normalizations genuinely differ.
* `NumberField.arakelovLogHeight₁_eq`: the local formula for the affine logarithmic height,
  with `log⁺ (v x)` at the finite places.
* `NumberField.mulHeight_le_arakelovMulHeight` and `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight_le_mulHeight`:
  the two comparisons with Mathlib's sup-norm height, the second with the constant
  `#ι ^ (totalWeight K / 2)`. These are what transport a constant stated for one normalization
  into the other, and the second is sharp: it is an equality at the all-ones tuple.
* `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight₁_le_mulHeight₁`: the affine case of the same, with constant
  `2 ^ (totalWeight K / 2)` — there is no equality `arakelovMulHeight₁ = mulHeight₁`.
* `Projectivization.mulHeight_le_arakelovMulHeight` and
  `Projectivization.arakelovMulHeight_le_mulHeight`: the same two comparisons on projective space,
  where the heights of Layer 3 live. The first is what makes the Northcott property of Layer 1.1
  carry over to the Arakelov normalization, since it bounds the sup-norm height by the Arakelov
  one with no constant at all.

## Implementation notes

As for `Height.mulHeight`, the zero tuple gets the junk value `1`: the displayed product is `0`
there, which would break `1 ≤ arakelovMulHeight` and the comparison with `Height.mulHeight`.
`NumberField.arakelovMulHeight_eq` recovers the displayed formula for a nonzero tuple, and every
statement below holds unconditionally with this convention.

The index type carries `Fintype` rather than `Finite` because the archimedean local factor is a
`Finset.sum` over `ι`; the value does not depend on the instance.

Only the archimedean factor differs from `NumberField.mulHeight_eq`. Accordingly the proof of
scaling invariance does not redo the product-formula bookkeeping at the finite places: the
transformation law of the finite part is *extracted* from Mathlib's
`Height.mulHeight_smul_eq_mulHeight`, which is the only place where the two normalizations
interact here.

Not every lemma of `Mathlib.NumberTheory.Height.Basic` has an Arakelov analogue, and the two that
fail are not edge cases. `Height.mulHeight_pow` is **false** here — the ℓ² norm is not
multiplicative under coordinatewise powers — and with it `mulHeight₁_pow` and `mulHeight₁_zpow`.
`Height.mulHeight_comp_le` is **false** for a non-injective reindexing, since repeating a
coordinate raises the ℓ² norm at the archimedean places while no sup norm can see the repetition;
it is the injective case that its consumers use. Both are refuted among the examples at the end of
this file.

(2006), Definition 2.8.1 and 2.8.2–2.8.3, where `H_u` is the local factor above and `h_Ar` the
resulting height on projective space. Their `h_Ar` is the *absolute* height — its local
exponent is `[F_w : ℚ_p] / [F : ℚ]` — whereas `arakelovMulHeight` here is *relative* to `K`,
matching Mathlib's `Height.mulHeight`; the two differ by the exponent `[K : ℚ]`.

This is Layers 0.1 and 0.2 of the `ArithmeticHeights` roadmap: the normalization and its
comparison with `Height.mulHeight`.

### Scaling invariance

The archimedean local factor scales by `v c ^ mult v` and the finite one by `v c`, so the
product formula makes the height invariant. The finite half of that computation is already in
Mathlib, inside `Height.mulHeight_smul_eq_mulHeight`; we read it off rather than redo it.

### Special values

`Height.mulHeight (1 : ι → K) = 1` by the product formula, but the Arakelov height of the same
tuple is `#ι ^ (totalWeight K / 2)`: these are the values that exhibit the difference between
the two normalizations without touching the junk value.

### The comparison with the sup-norm height

`‖·‖_∞ ≤ ‖·‖_2 ≤ √(#ι) · ‖·‖_∞` at each archimedean place, raised to the weight `mult v` and
multiplied over the places; the finite parts of the two heights are the same number and factor
out. This is Layer 0.2 of the roadmap: the pair of lemmas that transports a constant stated for
the Arakelov height into Mathlib's normalization and back, and so the reason a bound in either
normalization is a bound in the other.

The constant of the upper comparison cannot be improved: at the all-ones tuple it is an equality,
by `arakelovMulHeight_one` against `Height.mulHeight_one`.

### The one-variable case

`arakelovMulHeight₁ x` is the Arakelov height of the point `(x : 1)` of the projective line.
Unlike the sup-norm normalization, its archimedean local factor is `((v x) ^ 2 + 1) ^ (mult v / 2)`
rather than `max (v x) 1 ^ mult v`, so it does **not** agree with `Height.mulHeight₁`.

one-variable heights: `arakelovMulHeight₁ = mulHeight₁` is false, already at `x = 1`.

/-!
### The descent to projective space

Scaling invariance makes the Arakelov height a well-defined function on
`Projectivization K (ι → K)`, exactly as for `Projectivization.mulHeight`.

#### Comparison of the two normalizations on projective space

`NumberField.mulHeight_le_arakelovMulHeight` and `NumberField.arakelovMulHeight_le_mulHeight` read
on `Projectivization K (ι → K)`. Both sides are computed on any representative, so the comparisons
descend to projective space with the same constant.

### `positivity` extensions

The Arakelov heights are positive (multiplicative) resp. nonnegative (logarithmic), exactly as
their sup-norm counterparts in `Mathlib.NumberTheory.Height.Basic`.

### Worked examples

Cheap checks that the definition means what it should. Over `ℚ` the two normalizations of the
height of the point `(1 : 1)` genuinely differ, so the `√N` factors in the Siegel-lemma
literature are not cosmetic and a proof that silently interchanges the two heights is wrong.

The third shows that the constant of `arakelovMulHeight_le_mulHeight` is attained, so it cannot be
improved. The last two are rejection tests: they refute the two lemmas of
`Mathlib.NumberTheory.Height.Basic` that a reader would expect to carry over to this normalization
and that do not.
